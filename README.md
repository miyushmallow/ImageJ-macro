# ImageJ-macro
macros for analysis of microtubular architecture in confocal z-stacks, the macros loop over directories of z-stacks as well as each slice in the image. The output then gets saved under a new folder converted into a 8-bit TIFF file. 
To select a single cell to work with in your images, please create an ROI before use and clear outside to reduce interfering background noise.
